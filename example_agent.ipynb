    "\n",
    "LLM agents use large language models (LLMs) to decide which tools to use for interacting with their environment during multi-step task solving. Tool usage is done via function calling. The LLM is prompted or fine-tuned to generate JSON output representing one or more function calls. To ensure that the JSON output of an LLM follows a tool-specific schema one can use constrained decoding methods to control next token generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, [grammar-based sampling](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/1773) available in llama.cpp is used for constrained decoding. A JSON schema of available tools is converted to a grammar used for generating instances of that schema (= tool calls) during decoding. This is used for implementing a function calling interface for a Llama-2-70b model, an LLM with (limited) tool usage capabilities. \n",

    "The [implementation](https://github.com/krasserm/grammar-based-agents) uses LangChain interfaces and is compatible LangChain's [agent framework](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/).

    "`ToolCalling` adds tool calling functionality to the wrapped `chat_model`, resulting in an interface very similar to the function calling interface of `ChatOpenAI`. It converts a list of provided tools to a [oneOf](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/combining#oneof) JSON schema and submits it to the wrapped chat model. It also constructs a system prompt internally that informs the backend LLM about the presence of these tools and adds a special `respond_to_user` tool used by the LLM for providing a final response."

This message contains the JSON schema of the provided tools so that the tool call can be generated with grammar-based sampling."
