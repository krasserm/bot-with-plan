Create a valid Python script for the following task:

```
Raise Vittoria Ceretti's age to the power of 0.7.
```

Exclusively use this context information as input:

```
Leonardo DiCaprio's current girlfriend is Italian model Vittoria Ceretti.
Vittoria Ceretti is 25 years old.
```

The Python script must calculate a single number and assign it to variable "result". Always replace variables in context information with their actual values.
