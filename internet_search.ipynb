    "## Enhancing Internet Search with RAG and Open Large Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "This article introduces an internet search tool based on [Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://qdrant.tech/articles/what-is-rag-in-ai/), designed to answer questions posed in natural language. It searches the internet for relevant information and generates concise responses based on the search results.\n",
    "The tool is designed for local deployment, utilizing smaller open LLMs (specifically [Llama3-8B](https://huggingface.co/krasserm/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF)) and a local metasearch engine. This setup eliminates the need for external search-API keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "To dive straight into using the tool, skip ahead to the [Usage and examples](internet_search.ipynb#Usage-and-examples) section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improving Search Accuracy and Relevance with RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "Answering questions with large language models (LLMs) alone faces two major challenges. First, these models can produce hallucinations, presenting fabricated or inaccurate information as factual. Second, the answers provided by LLMs are constrained by their knowledge cutoff date, meaning they cannot provide information more current than their last update. This results in responses that may not only be outdated but also incorrect. The RAG-based internet search tool is designed to overcome these specific shortcomings. It addresses the issue of outdated knowledge by fetching current and relevant information directly from the internet. Additionally, it mitigates the problem of hallucinations by providing the LLM with factual information, instructing it to extract the most relevant information from the prompt and generate a precise and comprehensive answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The search tool utilizes the open-source [SearXNG](https://github.com/searxng/searxng) metasearch engine to collect information from multiple internet sources. It uses a [reranking model](https://huggingface.co/mixedbread-ai/mxbai-rerank-large-v1) to rank the returned results by relevance, and employs a locally deployed [Llama3-8B](https://huggingface.co/krasserm/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF) model to process search results and generate a response. The tool was specifically designed to work with smaller models like [Llama3-8B](https://huggingface.co/krasserm/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF), which has a limited context size of 8192 tokens and fewer capabilities compared to larger open-source models such as Llama3-70B, or commercial models like GPT-4.\n",
    "Instead of passing all the information from an internet search directly to the model for response generation - a strategy suited to larger models - the tool implements multiple pre-processing steps for each search result. It extracts the most relevant information and compiles a single summary for each webpage. This process allows the response generation LLM to focus on the information most relevant to the query and ensures that the context size limit is not exceeded.\n",
    "\n",
    "The internet search tool is a component of the [bot-with-plan](README.md) project. It can be used either as a standalone tool or by an agent equipped with tool-handling capabilities. This is illustrated in [Planner fine-tuning on synthetic agent trajectories](planner_finetuned.ipynb) where the internet search tool is integrated into an agentic workflow that uses tools, implementing an agentic RAG approach."

    "#### Stage 1: Query Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "Queries are typically expressed in natural language and often include extraneous details that might degrade the effectiveness of a search engine.

    "### Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "While the search tool generally performs well, there are several areas that could be improved in future work:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Support for dynamic web pages: currently, the search tool is limited to loading static pages.  Supporting dynamic web content that utilizes JavaScript would provide access to a broader spectrum of information.\n",
    "* SearXNG search provider configuration: at present, the configuration of search providers is restricted to ensure reliable outputs. Expanding the number of search providers and sources would increase the diversity of the search results.\n",
    "* Optimization of pipeline steps: the accuracy of individual search pipeline steps (query rewriting, content extraction, and response generation) could be improved by further refinement of the LLM prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we discussed the capabilities and design of a RAG-based internet search tool that leverages the power of smaller, open-source Large Language Models like Llama3-8B. By integrating these models with the SearXNG metasearch engine, this tool addresses significant challenges in information retrieval using large language models - such as the issues of outdated information and hallucinations. The practical setup described not only ensures that the information retrieved is current and relevant to the intput query but also tailored to fit within the constraints of smaller models. Importantly, the entire system is designed to run locally, providing access to diverse internet sources without the complexities of external APIs."
