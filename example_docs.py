    "Leonardo DiCaprio has once more found love. Following a summer of leisure on the beaches "
    "of Sardinia and an excursion to the Balearic Islands, including Ibiza and Formentera, the "
    "famous actor has been sighted in California accompanied by the Italian model Vittoria Ceretti.",

    "Vittoria Ceretti is an Italian fashion model renowned for her significant "
    "impact on the fashion industry. At the age of 25, she has already walked for esteemed fashion houses "
    "like Chanel, Dolce & Gabbana, and Versace, marking her prominence in the world of high fashion. Her "
    "remarkable presence extends to the covers of major fashion magazines, including Vogue, highlighting "
    "her as a leading figure in contemporary modeling.",

    "Sharks belong to a group of fish known as Elasmobranchii and have existed for over 400 million "
    "years. The earliest known sharks date back to the early Devonian period, roughly 420 million years "
    "ago. These early sharks were quite different from the modern sharks we are familiar with today, "
    "often smaller and with simpler structures.",

    "Octopuses, along with other cephalopods, have a slightly more recent origin. The earliest cephalopods "
    "are thought to have appeared during the late Cambrian period, around 500 million years ago, but these "
    "were not octopuses as we know them today. The first true octopuses are much more recent, likely "
    "appearing in the Cretaceous period, about 155 million years ago.",

    "The first elephants, or more precisely, the ancestors of modern elephants, appeared on Earth around "
    "55 million years ago. These early proboscideans, the group that includes elephants, mammoths, and "
    "mastodons, evolved from small, terrestrial mammal ancestors. Over millions of years, they diversified "
    "and spread throughout Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America, with many species increasing in size and "
    "developing the characteristic long trunks and large tusks we associate with elephants today. The most "
    "direct ancestors of today's elephants emerged around 5 to 6 million years ago.",
